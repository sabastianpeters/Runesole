NOTES:

In an idea situtation, the engine would be compiled in a seperate assembly from the game classes. This would allow for the use of "internal" on Engine only methods and members that are required to be public. This would further improve ease of creation. This was an oversight during creation and not enough time to do this by the end of project.
